## Project Description

The Infinity Flow S1 is a universal filament switcher designed to bring seamless automation to any 3D printer. This repository offers a collection of CAD models for adapters that can be used to connect the S1 to various printer types. These models are freely available for download and modification to suit your specific needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A 3D printer with compatible software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
- CAD software like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or any STL viewer to open and modify the files if needed.

### Downloading the Models
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file directly from GitHub.
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/infinity-flow-s1-adapters.git
   
3. Navigate to the folder containing the CAD models.
4. Open the files in your preferred CAD software or upload the STL files directly to your slicing software.

## Usage

### How to Use the CAD Models
1. **Download the Model**: Choose the appropriate adapter model for your 3D printer from the list below.
2. **Print the Model**: Use your 3D printer to print the adapter. Make sure your printer settings are configured correctly for the material you are using (e.g., PLA, ABS).
3. **Install the Adapter**: Attach the printed adapter to your printer's extruder or Bowden tube input as shown in the examples below.
4. **Run the S1**: Connect the S1 to your printer using the installed adapter and enjoy seamless filament switching.

### Example Adapters
- **Prusa Mark 4 Adapter**: A threaded adapter for easy connection.
- **Ender 3 Adapter**: A simple adapter for printers with a hole-style filament insertion.
- **Pulse Adapter**: Customizable adapter piece that fits onto existing hardware.
